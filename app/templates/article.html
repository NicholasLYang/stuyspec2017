        The White House was busy on Wednesday rolling out an outline of Trump’s tax plan, but it did apparently find the time to reconsider. There was a meeting of the National Economic Council, which is headed by Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs, and includes Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary—both of whom are known as supporters of free trade. And on Wednesday afternoon, Trump spoke by telephone with Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, and Enrique Peña Nieto, the President of Mexico. Late Wednesday night, the White House issued a statement that said, “President Trump agreed not to terminate nafta at this time and the leaders agreed to proceed swiftly, according to their required internal procedures, to enable the renegotiation of the nafta deal to the benefit of all three countries.”
